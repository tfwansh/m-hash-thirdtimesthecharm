## Securing Community Mesh Networks Against Localized Worm Propagation - Round 1

### Background

Grassroots mesh networks—community-driven, peer-to-peer Wi-Fi systems—are gaining traction in underserved and remote areas as a means of providing decentralized and resilient internet access. These networks empower local connectivity without dependence on centralized infrastructure, making them vital for education, healthcare, and emergency communication. However, their decentralized nature introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Without a central authority to monitor or secure the mesh, a single compromised node can rapidly spread malware or network worms. This can lead to communication blackouts, data hijacking, and the isolation of entire neighborhoods—ultimately deepening digital divides rather than bridging them.

### Challenge

Traditional endpoint security solutions, such as antivirus software or centralized patch management, are ill-suited for self-organizing, distributed topologies. In mesh networks, any node can become an entry point for threats, and lack of real-time, coordinated defenses increases the risk of rapid, uncontrollable spread of infections.
